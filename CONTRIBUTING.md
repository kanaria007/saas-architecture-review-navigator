## ✅ Accepted Contributions

We welcome:

- ✅ **New design perspectives**  
  You are welcome to contribute new `.md` files in a consistent structure.  
  Use existing perspectives as reference, or check the [perspective template](./docs/perspective-template.md).

- ✅ **Improvements to existing perspectives**  
  Better phrasing, clearer logic, stronger examples, or added design rationale.

- ✅ **Additional FAQ**  
  Especially from real-world design discussions, incidents, or reviews.

- ✅ **Translation and internationalization**  
  Other languages (e.g. Japanese, Spanish) are welcome — just keep them separate from the core `docs/en/` folder.

- ✅ **AI-assisted writing — if curated**  
  You may use AI tools (ChatGPT, Grammarly, etc.) as long as the result is thoughtfully reviewed, edited, and aligns with the project's tone and structure.

## ❌ Not Accepted

To maintain coherence and clarity, we generally avoid:

- ❌ Pure style rewrites or rewordings that don't add clarity
- ❌ Alternate philosophical structures (please fork instead)
- ❌ Marketing links, product placements, SEO content
- ❌ Injecting uncurated AI-generated content

## ✨ Want to Add a Perspective?

You can! Please:

- Browse existing perspectives in `docs/categories/<category>/`
- Copy the [perspective template](./docs/perspective-template.md) to start
- Keep sections: What This Covers / Unsafe Patterns / Safer Design / FAQ
- Submit your `.md` file via PR with category placement

Not sure if your idea fits? Open a GitHub Issue and let's discuss it.

## 🎯 Balance of Philosophy and Flexibility

This navigator follows a consistent style and logic — but it's not dogmatic.

We accept:

- Slightly different phrasing styles
- New perspectives even if adjacent to existing ones
- Clarifying or extending design reasoning
- Practical additions from postmortems or onboarding experience

If you're unsure whether your idea fits — open an issue or a draft PR. We'll work it out together.

## ✍️ Tone and Respect

This project is written in English but originated in Japanese. Some phrasing may be unusual. PRs to improve clarity are appreciated.

We value:

- Clear and direct expression
- Respect for contributors' intent
- Improvement without ego

Thank you for helping improve this navigator.
