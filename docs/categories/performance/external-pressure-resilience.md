## 🧠 What This Is Really About

When an external dependency gets slow or flakey—  
what happens to your system?

- Do users get blocked?  
- Do retries pile up and crush the queue?  
- Does circuit breaking work as intended?

---

## 🚨 What Can Go Wrong

- Synchronous dependencies cause upstream timeouts  
- Retry storms triggered by brief outages  
- Thread or worker pools exhausted by long-waiting calls  
- Clients hammer your own API when a downstream system stalls  
- Errors misclassified as timeouts or 500s → no alert

---

## ✅ Healthier Patterns

- Use circuit breakers with fallback responses  
- Queue isolation: don’t let one downstream service monopolize capacity  
- Use retries with exponential backoff and jitter  
- Fast-fail logic for known high-latency paths  
- Alert on change in external latency profile, not just error rate

## ⚠️ Design Frame

Dependency pressure isn’t an edge case.  
It’s the **default condition of internet-scale systems**.

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: Can’t we just retry more?**  
  **A:** Not if it breaks everything else.

- **Q: Should we always fall back?**  
  **A:** Only if degraded UX is better than outage.
