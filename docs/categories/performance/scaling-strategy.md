# Is Your Scaling Strategy Designed—or Just Assumed?

## 🧠 What This Perspective Asks

- What happens when load triples overnight?  
- Which parts of the system become bottlenecks?  
- Do you scale up? Scale out? Degrade gracefully?

Most systems are “scalable”  
—until they actually scale.

---

## 🚨 What Breaks

- One database serves multiple high-traffic features  
- Horizontal scaling assumed, but stateful logic blocks it  
- Feature flags load config on every request  
- Per-tenant bottlenecks invisible in global metrics  
- Load testing ignores cold-start conditions

---

## ✅ Healthier Scaling Strategy

- Explicitly model resource ownership: CPU, DB, IOPS, mem  
- Plan per-feature and per-tenant scaling paths  
- Separate config loads from hot-paths  
- Test for hot-boot, cold-start, and partial-dependency performance  
- Define when degradation is acceptable—and what gets dropped first

## ⚠️ Design Philosophy

Scalability isn’t about infrastructure.  
It’s about knowing **which limits come first—and who they’ll hurt.**

---

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: But we’re on Kubernetes. Doesn’t it scale?**  
  **A:** Pods scale. Architectural limits don’t move.

- **Q: Should we optimize now or later?**  
  **A:** Design the escape hatch now. Use it later.
