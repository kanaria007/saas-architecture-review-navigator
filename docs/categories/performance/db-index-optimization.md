# Have You Designed Query Performance—or Just Hoped the DB “Handles It”?

## 🧠 What This Perspective Covers

This is not just about “adding indexes.”  
It’s about **designing for how queries behave under growth and concurrency.**

This touches:

- Index choice and placement  
- Query patterns (joins, filters, pagination)  
- Read amplification and disk cost  
- Cache invalidation and fallback paths

---

## 🚨 What Goes Wrong in Practice

- Latency spikes on pages nobody thought were critical  
- Multiple indexes fighting over the same table  
- Joins optimized for logic, not I/O locality  
- Filters on low-cardinality fields that kill index usefulness  
- No clear plan for data aging or pruning

---

## ✅ Healthier Performance Thinking

- Design queries from access pattern—not schema shape  
- Monitor “query heat” over time, not just in load tests  
- Write-specific indexes for read-heavy endpoints  
- Embrace partial indexes or filtered indexes where applicable  
- Plan index lifecycle: create, evolve, retire

---

## 🧠 Core Tradeoffs

You’re always balancing:

- Storage vs speed  
- Index maintenance cost vs query benefit  
- Latency variance vs code complexity

---

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: What if I don’t know which queries matter yet?**  
  **A:** Then build for observability first—optimize later.

- **Q: Can’t the ORM optimize this for us?**  
  **A:** It can write queries. It can’t make them good.
