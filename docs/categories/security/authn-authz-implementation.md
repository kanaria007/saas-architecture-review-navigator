## 🧠 What This Perspective Covers

Authentication (AuthN) and Authorization (AuthZ) are not features.  
They are **foundations**—and when shaky, everything on top suffers.

---

## 🚨 Auth Fragility Patterns

- Auth logic split across middlewares, controllers, services  
- Manual JWT parsing or unclear claim propagation  
- Mixing login session state with API token flows  
- Test environments bypass auth logic, causing drift from prod  
- Inconsistent roles or scope propagation across services

---

## ✅ Better Auth Design Practices

- Centralize auth verification into a testable, composable unit  
- Use middleware for identity extraction—but not decision logic  
- Define clear boundaries: AuthN (who?) vs AuthZ (can?)  
- Make roles, scopes, and tenants explicit in all internal requests  
- Test token expiration, claim tampering, and role confusion

## ⚠️ Principle

You don’t need custom auth.  
You need **custom enforcement of clear intent.**

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: Should we roll our own auth?**  
  **A:** Rarely. Prefer platform-backed identity—but enforce your own permission boundaries.

- **Q: Can’t middleware do everything?**  
  **A:** Middleware should extract identity—not decide business intent.
