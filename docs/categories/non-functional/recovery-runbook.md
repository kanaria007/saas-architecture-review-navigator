## 🧠 What This Perspective Covers

Incidents are inevitable.  
But how much damage they cause—and how long it lasts—depends on **whether the team knows what to do next**.

This perspective checks whether **your system has recovery steps documented, accessible, and tested under pressure.**

## 🔍 Situations That Demand Runbooks

- Downtime caused by DB overload or network partition  
- Stuck background jobs, retries, or event queue buildup  
- Misconfig or flag change leading to user-visible errors  
- Service-to-service dependency failure with cascade risk  
- Authentication/authorization outages blocking access

---

## 🚨 Failure Patterns

- Only senior devs know how to fix certain issues  
- Steps to restart a subsystem require tribal knowledge  
- Manual fixes are risky, undocumented, or error-prone  
- No clear timeline for response or escalation  
- On-call fatigue due to repeated “figure-it-out” recoveries

---

## ✅ Smarter Incident Recovery Design

- Write playbooks: if X fails, do Y (with context and safety tips)  
- Store runbooks with version control and team-wide access  
- Include not just “what” to do but “why” it matters  
- Automate common diagnostics or partial recovery steps  
- Review runbooks after incidents—treat them as living artifacts

---

## ⚠️ Principle

**Recovery is not just reaction.  
It’s practiced response under pressure.**

---

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: Isn’t every incident unique?**  
  **A:** Yes. But most share patterns. Good runbooks guide—not replace—thinking.

- **Q: Where should runbooks live?**  
  **A:** Wherever your on-call responders will find them in 30 seconds or less.
