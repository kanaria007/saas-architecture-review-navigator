## 🧠 What This Perspective Covers

A good UI shows **just enough**.

Not too little.  
Not too much.  
And never too slow.

---

## 🚨 UI Load Pitfalls

- Fetch-all endpoints crash browsers with large result sets  
- Slow tables that rerender entire DOM trees for 1000+ rows  
- Users can’t filter or search → manually scroll and scan  
- Data arrives async, but layout is designed for sync

---

## ✅ Healthier Load Strategies

- Define and enforce page size limits in API + UI  
- Provide filters, search, and progressive disclosure by default  
- Render skeletons or optimistic placeholders to mask delay  
- Prefetch adjacent pages, but load incrementally  
- Consider adaptive pagination for high-data users

## ⚠️ Principle

Performance isn’t just speed.  
**It’s perceived responsiveness.**

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: Can’t we just paginate everything?**  
  **A:** Not if users need to *search* before loading a page.

- **Q: Should frontend show a spinner?**  
  **A:** Only if it *explains the delay*.
