## 🧠 What This Perspective Covers

Testing is not only about what changed—  
but what the change might **touch**.

---

## 🚨 Blind Spot Patterns

- Code paths modified, but dependent behavior left untested  
- Flags or conditionals hide risk in less-used flows  
- Shared components updated with no regression test sweep  
- Devs test “the feature” but not “the impact”

---

## ✅ Safer Impact Modeling

- Map upstream and downstream dependencies for the change  
- Use code search or coverage diff tools to explore affected areas  
- Review “what else calls this”—not just what’s inside  
- Treat shared utilities or schemas as multi-context risks  
- Ask “who would be surprised by this change?”

## ⚠️ Key Principle

Good testing is risk tracing.  
**Not just behavior checking.**

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: Isn’t test coverage enough?**  
  **A:** No. Coverage doesn’t mean the right behavior is tested.

- **Q: Should reviewers repeat what CI does?**  
  **A:** No. Reviewers should think beyond it.
