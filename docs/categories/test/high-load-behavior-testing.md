## 🔍 What This Perspective Covers

Functional tests pass.  
Even performance tests might pass.  
But under stress—**systems don’t just slow down. They break.**

---

## ⚠️ Typical Misses

- Load tests stop at 80% CPU and never cross failure point  
- No simulation of retry storms, queue overflow, or memory saturation  
- Failure modes are untested: latency spikes, cascading failures, timeouts  
- SLOs assume averages—but user pain hides in the tail

---

## ✅ Resilience Testing Strategy

- Define failure thresholds: latency spike? error rate? resource usage?  
- Test retry behavior, backpressure, timeouts under real contention  
- Simulate partial outages or degraded upstreams  
- Observe auto-recovery, circuit breaking, alerting response  
- Run chaos tests (within scoped blast radius) before peak seasons

## 🧠 Core Insight

A stable system under light load proves nothing.  
**Only under pressure does architecture reveal its fault lines.**

---

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: Isn’t this just performance testing?**  
  **A:** No. This is testing *failure* under load—not just slowness.

- **Q: What if the test breaks things?**  
  **A:** That’s the point. Better to break it intentionally.
