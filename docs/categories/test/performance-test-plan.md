## 🧠 What This Perspective Covers

Performance is not a trait.  
It’s a **commitment**—and must be proven.

---

## 🚨 Common Omissions

- No test plan for API under load, despite expected concurrency  
- “Performance” assumed because staging was fast  
- DB load patterns not simulated (e.g. long tail, batch updates)  
- No thresholds defined: what is “slow”? what is “acceptable”?

---

## ✅ Healthier Performance Design

- Decide: is perf testing needed? when? what endpoints or flows?  
- Define load shape: bursty? spiky? sustained?  
- Prepare test data to mimic real-world skew  
- Measure tail latency and failure rates—not just averages  
- Include perf test outcomes in release Go/No-Go

---

## ⚠️ Key Principle

Latency isn’t a number.  
It’s a **contractual boundary** that must be honored under pressure.

---

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: Isn’t CI/CD enough to detect slowness?**  
  **A:** No. Load must be synthetic, controlled, and scenario-aware.

- **Q: What if we can’t test full scale?**  
  **A:** Test bottlenecks under partial load with extrapolation.
