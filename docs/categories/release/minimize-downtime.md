## üîç What This Perspective Covers

Some releases will require downtime.  
But not all downtime is equal.

This perspective examines how to **minimize service disruption**, both in duration and impact.

Example Scenarios

- DB migrations with exclusive locks  
- Monolithic systems with no hot-reload mechanism  
- Large-scale batch updates that cannot stream  
- Deployments needing cross-node coordination resets

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Failure Patterns

- All users experience full downtime for minutes or hours  
- No estimation or communication of window timing  
- Scheduled at peak traffic times  
- Restoration needs manual intervention or coordination

---

## ‚úÖ Smarter Downtime Planning

- Can the system be partially up (read-only mode, admin-only)?  
- Split change into multiple smaller steps with partial releases  
- Schedule based on traffic analytics, not guesswork  
- Provide countdowns or banners in UI to prepare users  
- Have automated recovery and alerting tied to restart conditions

---

## üß† Principle

**Downtime is sometimes inevitable.  
But user surprise and prolonged recovery are not.**

## ‚ùì FAQ

- **Q: Can we guarantee zero downtime?**  
  **A:** Not always. But minimizing blast radius is always possible.

- **Q: Is partial service worse than full downtime?**  
  **A:** Depends‚Äîtransparent partial availability is often better than full lockout.
