## 🔍 What This Perspective Covers

Backups are not recovery.  
What matters is whether you can bring the system back to a safe and consistent state—**under pressure**.

This perspective examines whether **data-level restoration plans are explicitly designed** and aligned with real-world failure cases.

---

## ⚠️ Failure Patterns

- Backups exist but recovery steps are undocumented  
- Full restore is possible but takes hours—no SLA defined  
- Only infra is recovered; business logic state is broken  
- Restore causes duplicate records or version conflict  
- RTO/RPO is undefined, untested, or unrealistic

## ✅ Design Patterns for Recovery

### 🔧 Technical Mechanisms

- Point-in-time restore from WAL or snapshots  
- Restore specific tenant data without full rollback  
- Rehydrate indexes or caches from durable storage  
- Idempotent replay of external sync steps  
- Rollback incomplete transactional writes

### 🛠 Operational Practices

- Document exact restore paths per failure class  
- Automate restore playbooks for high-risk systems  
- Test restore regularly under simulated pressure  
- Include logs, blobs, and async queues in recovery scope  
- Align RTO/RPO with actual SLA expectations

## 🧠 Principle

**You didn’t “recover” if you came back broken.  
Recovery means: consistent, complete, and usable.**

---

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: Isn’t backup enough?**  
  **A:** No. Backup is storage. Recovery is reassembly under pressure.

- **Q: How often should we test recovery?**  
  **A:** For critical paths: quarterly. For infra-wide: at least twice a year.
