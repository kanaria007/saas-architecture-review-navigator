## 🔍 What This Perspective Covers

Having a backup is not the same as having a **reliable, restorable backup**.

This perspective checks whether the **backup plan is clearly defined**, covering all critical system states—not just the database.

---

## ⚠️ Failure Patterns

- Only DB is backed up → app state, blobs, configs lost  
- Snapshots are scheduled but never tested  
- Encrypted backups without stored keys  
- Retention policy too short for real incident investigations  
- Backups stored in same region as production

---

## ✅ What Should Be Backed Up?

- Application DB: RDS, CloudSQL, etc.  
- Blob storage: S3, GCS, user uploads  
- Message queues and in-flight events  
- Secrets and configuration state  
- Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Helm, etc.)  
- Audit logs and billing data

## ✅ Smarter Backup Design

- List backup scope by component: what, when, how, where  
- Set retention periods by legal, business, and recovery needs  
- Store backups cross-region and secure (access-controlled, encrypted)  
- Define access recovery procedure: who can restore what  
- Monitor backup job success and validate integrity regularly

## 🧠 Principle

**Backups are promises.  
A broken promise at recovery time is a system failure.**

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: Isn’t snapshotting enough?**  
  **A:** Snapshots are one layer. You need multiple layers, verified.

- **Q: How do we know if our backup is working?**  
  **A:** Restore it. Periodically. Under real failure conditions.
