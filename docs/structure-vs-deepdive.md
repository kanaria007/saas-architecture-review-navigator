# Structure vs DeepDive

This framework distinguishes between two levels of architectural design perspectives:

- **Structure**: Focused on design fundamentals, responsibility separation, and abstraction clarity.
- **DeepDive**: Focused on complex implementations, performance, failure handling, and reliability.

Use both axes to balance high-level clarity and low-level risk management.
