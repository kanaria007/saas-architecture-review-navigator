## 🔍 What This Perspective Covers

Releases don’t need to be all-or-nothing.

A stepwise rollout lets you control exposure, validate assumptions, and absorb failure safely.

Example Patterns

- Start with internal users → select customers → general audience  
- Use feature flags or remote config to gate access  
- Canary deployment at infra level (e.g., 5% traffic routing)  
- Schedule releases to coincide with low-traffic windows per tenant group

---

## ⚠️ Failure Patterns

- Releasing to all users before observing risk  
- Lacking rollback plan for each phase  
- No versioning or toggle per group → rollout becomes binary  
- Deployment pipelines can’t segment by tenant or region

---

## ✅ Smart Staged Release Design

- Define cohorts: which users/tenants go first, and why?  
- Add observability per group: errors, latency, usage patterns  
- Ensure rollback path exists at each step—not just final one  
- Use flags/toggles to enable fast gating or rollback  
- Communicate phase plans across teams to align timing

## 🧠 Principle

**Speed is not in full release.  
Speed is in safe, observable rollout.**

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: Is this just “canary deploy”?**  
  **A:** Canary is one technique. Staged release is broader—can include feature flags, tenants, timing.

- **Q: Does this slow us down?**  
  **A:** No. It makes success repeatable—failure recoverable.
