## 🔍 What This Perspective Covers

You don’t truly own a system until you can safely undo its changes.

This perspective examines whether rollback paths are designed, validated, and executable—**not just documented**.

Real-World Risk Cases

- DB schema migration that drops columns  
- Batch jobs that transform or delete data  
- Feature rollout that modifies shared state  
- Deployment that bypasses blue/green isolation

---

## ⚠️ Failure Patterns

- Rollback scripts exist but have never been tested  
- Infra rollback is possible, but data state is irreversible  
- Team assumes “fix forward” without safeguards  
- No plan to rollback partially completed operations

---

## ✅ Smarter Rollback Strategy

- Identify irreversible operations early (schema, state, external calls)  
- Separate schema rollout and feature exposure if possible  
- Test rollback in staging—including data rollback  
- Automate rollback as a first-class pipeline step  
- Pair with alerting: know when rollback is needed and whether it worked

---

## 🧠 Principle

**Rollback is not backup.  
It’s an engineered return path.**

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: Do we always need rollback?**  
  **A:** No. But if rollback isn’t feasible, pre-checks and isolation become more critical.

- **Q: What’s the difference between rollback and revert?**  
  **A:** Rollback implies cleanup and recovery, not just code diff reversal.
