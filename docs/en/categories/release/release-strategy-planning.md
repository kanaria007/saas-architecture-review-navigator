# Is the Release Strategy Defined and Aligned With Change Impact?

## üîç What This Perspective Covers

Release is not deployment.  
It is a negotiation with failure.

Even small changes can cause large damage if release strategy is not considered‚Äî  
especially under multi-tenant, distributed, or asynchronous conditions.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Failure Patterns

- All-or-nothing deploy with no rollback path  
- Feature exposure tied directly to deploy, no toggles or controls  
- DB schema changes without forward/backward compatibility  
- Downtime assumed as ‚Äúunavoidable‚Äù due to monolithic migration  
- Release timing misaligned with business risk window (e.g. peak hours)

---

## ‚úÖ Typical Use Cases

- Canary rollout to 5% tenants before global rollout  
- Feature toggle to decouple code merge from exposure  
- DB migration that is compatible across both old and new app versions  
- Stepwise exposure: staging ‚Üí internal users ‚Üí selected customers ‚Üí all users

## üß† Better Release Strategy Design

Key Principle

Release ‚â† Code Delivery  
**Release = Risk Framing + Controlled Exposure**

- Classify the change: is it visible? breaking? reversible?  
- Design rollout method: toggle, staged, canary, delayed exposure  
- Include rollback mechanism *before* merge (infra and data both)  
- Define observability points: error surge? retry rate? latency spike?  
- Coordinate internally: who needs to know when and why

## ‚ùì FAQ

- **Q: Why not fix forward?**  
  **A:** That works only when blast radius is controlled and recovery is fast.

- **Q: Is staging enough?**  
  **A:** No. Only real traffic reveals integration cracks.

- **Q: Who owns release design?**  
  **A:** Every team must own it for what they ship.
