## 🔍 What This Perspective Covers

No system is immune to failure.

This perspective verifies whether **your most critical processing paths** can survive machine failure, zone failure, or sudden disconnects—without human intervention.

---

## ⚠️ Failure Patterns

- Failover is “planned” but never tested  
- Infra auto-recovers, but app logic is not restart-tolerant  
- Stateful nodes fail without handover of critical context  
- Observability gaps during failover → unclear if recovery succeeded

---

## ✅ Smarter Failover Design

### ✅ Critical Examples

- Background tasks move to a healthy worker if one dies  
- API gateway can reroute across availability zones  
- DB read replicas are promoted on primary failure  
- Leader election recovers quorum-based consensus  
- External dependency is wrapped with circuit breakers and fallback paths

### ✅ Design Considerations

- Classify “critical to user experience” vs. “non-critical background”  
- Simulate infrastructure chaos regularly—not just unit tests  
- Use health checks and probes to drive failover triggers  
- Ensure handoff design preserves state or tolerates partial loss  
- Log and alert failover triggers and results clearly

## 🧠 Principle

**Failover is not a feature.  
It’s a testable architectural constraint.**

---

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: Is infra-level HA (like multi-AZ) enough?**  
  **A:** No. Apps need to be designed to survive unexpected restart and failover.

- **Q: What does “simulate chaos” mean?**  
  **A:** Kill nodes. Disconnect network. Monitor outcomes.
