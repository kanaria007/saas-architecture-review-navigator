# Is the Logging Strategy Sufficient for Troubleshooting?

## 🔍 What This Perspective Covers

Logs are not just for developers—they’re lifelines during failure.

This perspective checks whether your logging strategy provides **enough context and structure** to support fast, reliable incident diagnosis and postmortem analysis.

Logging Pain Points

- No correlation ID between API, job, and DB traces  
- User actions are not clearly tied to internal events  
- Logs only show stack traces, not system state  
- High-volume logs drown out important anomalies  
- Sensitive data appears in logs or is overly redacted

---

## ⚠️ Failure Patterns

- “It failed” but no insight into why or what triggered it  
- Can’t trace user impact across distributed components  
- Devs need to SSH into prod to find relevant logs  
- No logs around failure-time due to buffering or crash  
- Logging format inconsistency breaks analysis tools

---

## ✅ Smarter Logging Design

- Use structured logging: JSON or context-rich formats  
- Always include request ID, user ID, operation name  
- Log inputs, outcomes, and durations—not just errors  
- Define log levels clearly: info, warn, error, fatal  
- Secure logs with access control and field redaction

## 🧠 Principle

**If your logs can’t explain failure,  
they’re just expensive noise.**

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: Should everything be logged?**  
  **A:** No. Log only what you’d need in a crisis—and ensure it’s understandable.

- **Q: What’s structured logging?**  
  **A:** Log data as key-value pairs with traceable metadata, not raw text blobs.
