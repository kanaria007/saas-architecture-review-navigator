# 📄 Perspective Template – *SaaS Architecture Review Navigator Aligned*

> A refined, production-grade format for scalable architectural insight  
> Focus: *Causal clarity / Failure realism / Design principles / Contextual framing*

## 🔍 What This Perspective Examines

- What class of **architectural concern** or **systemic failure mode** does this relate to?  
- Why is this **non-obvious but high-impact** in real SaaS systems?

> *Example framing:*  
> This perspective examines how retry logic without bounded scope or observability can silently convert transient errors into cascading systemic degradation.

## ⚠️ Failure-Pattern Recognition

- What design patterns are **commonly observed in production** that silently degrade resilience, correctness, or clarity?  
- Which **anti-patterns seem valid in tests but fail in production-shaped reality**?

> *Example:*
>
> - Retry logic with no cap or jitter  
> - Conflating error visibility with observability  
> - Client-side retries causing server overload during downstream degradation

---

## ✅ Healthier Design Framing

- What structural practices mitigate these risks?
- Where are the trade-offs—latency, consistency, UX degradation?

> *Example patterns:*
>
> - Use **bounded retries with exponential backoff + jitter**  
> - Treat **retry attempts as observability events**, not silent background recovery  
> - Design fallback paths with **explicit UX trade-offs**

---

## 🧠 Underlying Design Principle

> *One sentence, causal and provocative. Not a slogan.*
>
> *Example:*  
> **Retries are not recovery—they're deferred risk. Design them as failure paths, not optimism.**

## ❓ Reasoning-Driven FAQs

- **Q: Why not retry infinitely?**  
  **A:** Because unbounded retries hide unrecoverable states and cause systemic coupling under pressure.

- **Q: Should fallback always show error?**  
  **A:** Only if silent degradation causes more harm than visible failure.

## 🧭 Author’s Note *(Optional)*

> This perspective originated from real-world incidents in system X, where optimistic retry logic caused unbounded SQS buildup during a downstream auth outage.  
> Retrospective analysis revealed insufficient isolation and missing observability around retry volume.
