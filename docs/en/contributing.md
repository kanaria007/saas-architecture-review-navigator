# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in improving this design navigator.

This repository aims to provide a **clear, opinionated, and minimally biased design perspective framework**.  
All contributions are appreciated, but some boundaries are enforced to preserve its structural and philosophical intent.

---

## ✅ Accepted Contributions

The following types of contributions are welcome:

- ✅ **Spelling, grammar, and clarity fixes**  
  Improve readability or phrasing in English without altering meaning.

- ✅ **Formatting or structural consistency**  
  Aligning Markdown conventions, improving navigation links, or anchor fixes.

- ✅ **Linking related perspectives**  
  Adding or correcting internal references between design documents.

- ✅ **Minor content clarification**  
  Rewording for precision or developer comprehension, if meaning is preserved.

- ✅ **Improving GitHub workflow integration**  
  Enhancements such as better `mkdocs.yml` configuration, GitHub Pages setup, or contributor tooling are welcome.
  (Note: I'm personally not very familiar with these areas, so contributions here would be especially appreciated.)

## 🚫 Not Accepted

The following changes are unlikely to be merged:

- ❌ **Rewriting design logic or structure**  
  This repository reflects a specific architectural worldview.  
  Alternate philosophies should be developed in forks.

- ❌ **Turning the content into tutorials or textbooks**  
  The goal is decision-making scaffolding, not step-by-step guides.

- ❌ **Adding product/vendor-specific patterns**  
  This navigator is intended to be SaaS-agnostic and structurally general.

- ❌ **Injecting AI-generated or templated content** without human curation  
  All content must be conceptually and structurally vetted.
