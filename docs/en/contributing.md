Thank you for considering a contribution.  
This project thrives on thoughtful insights, practical experience, and collaborative refinement.

## ‚úÖ What You Can Contribute

We welcome contributions that strengthen the navigator as a **thinking tool**, not just a checklist.

- **New Perspectives**  
  Add a new `.md` file following the [Perspective Template](https://github.com/kanaria007/saas-architecture-review-navigator/blob/main/docs/en/perspective-template.md).  
  Think in terms of:  
  > What design tension does this help resolve?

- **Improvements to Existing Perspectives**  
  Clarify, correct, or extend content.  
  For example:  
  - Better phrasing or logic  
  - Clearer examples or diagrams  
  - Stronger design justification

- **Real-World FAQ Additions**  
  If you‚Äôve faced a recurring question in postmortems or design reviews‚Äîcapture it here.

- **Translations**  
  Additional languages are welcome. Place translated content in a language-specific subfolder (e.g. `docs/ja/`).

- **AI-Assisted Writing (If Reviewed)**  
  You may use tools like ChatGPT or Grammarly to draft or revise content‚Äî**but human curation is required**.

## ‚ùå What We Avoid

To keep the navigator focused and coherent, we do not accept:

- Pure rewrites that reduce clarity  
- Style-only edits with no semantic gain  
- Alternate philosophy proposals (please fork instead)  
- SEO-driven or promotional content  
- Raw, unedited AI dumps

## üß≠ Contribution Principles

> This project is structured‚Äîbut not dogmatic.

We encourage:

- ‚ú≥Ô∏è **Concrete insights grounded in real-world design experience**  
  > We welcome contributions based on real incidents, trade-offs, or architectural decisions‚Äî  
  > as long as the insight generalizes beyond a specific tech stack.

- Multiple phrasing styles, if they clarify thinking  
- Similar perspectives that highlight different trade-offs  
- Expansion of architectural reasoning‚Äînot just syntax or naming

## ‚úçÔ∏è Tone, Clarity, and Respect

This project originated in Japanese and was translated for global readability.  
We value:

- Precision over polish  
- Clarity over cleverness  
- Insight over opinion
